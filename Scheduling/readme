Lab 2: Scheduling

Readme File

Instructions:
Compile with command: "g++ lab2.cpp -o lab2" (without quotes)
run with 
"./lab2 [-s<schedspec>] <inputfile path> <randfile path>"
(without quotes and brackets)

As specified in the assignment, the scheduler specification is:
"-s [ FLS | R<num> ]", where F=FCFS, L=LCFS, S=SJF and R10 is RR with quantum 10. 



Notes:
**the -v option is NOT built in, and the program will not accept it.

** the program assumes inputfile and randfile are well formed.

**if a scheduler spec other than F,L,S, or R is given, the program will print an error message and abort.

**if a quantum of less than or equal to 0 is given, the program will print an error message and abort.
